# Team Profile Generator

![licenseBadge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-informational)

## Description
This command line application generates a webpage containing the information of team members based on responses to prompts entered by the user.

The application is built using a combination of HTML, Javascript and Node.JS with the Inquirer and Jest packages installed.

This task has given me a real appreciation of the Jest tool as the tests that had been written out allowed me to understand why my code wasn't working at times. Additionally, being able to write Classes and Subclasses has been very fulfilling!
